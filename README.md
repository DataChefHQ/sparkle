# Sparkle ✨

**Sparkle** is a meta-framework built on top of [Apache
Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), designed to streamline data
engineering workflows and accelerate the delivery of data
products. Developed by [**DataChef**](https://datachef.co), Sparkle
focuses on three main areas:

1. **Improving Developer Experience (DevEx) 🚀**
2. **Reducing Time to Market ⏱️**
3. **Easy Maintenance 🔧**

With these goals in mind, Sparkle has enabled DataChef to deliver
functional data products from day one, allowing for seamless handovers
to internal teams.

## Key Features

### 1. Improved Developer Experience 🚀

Sparkle enhances the developer experience by abstracting away
non-business-critical aspects of Spark application development. It
achieves this through:

- **Sophisticated Configuration Mechanism**: Simplifies the setup and
  configuration of Spark applications, allowing developers to focus
  solely on business logic.
- **Automatic Functional Tests 🧪**: Generates tests for each
  application automatically, based on predefined input and output
  fixtures. This ensures that the application behaves as expected
  without requiring extensive manual testing.

### 2. Reduced Time to Market ⏱️

Sparkle significantly reduces the time to market by automating the
deployment and testing processes. This allows data engineers to
concentrate exclusively on developing the business logic, with all
other aspects handled by Sparkle:

- **Automated Testing ✅**: Ensures that all applications are robust
  and ready for deployment without manual intervention.
- **Seamless Deployment 🚢**: Automates the deployment pipeline,
  reducing the time needed to bring new data products to market.

### 3. Enhanced Maintenance 🔧

Sparkle simplifies maintenance through heavy testing and abstraction
of non-business functional requirements. This provides a reliable and
trustworthy system that is easy to maintain:

- **Abstraction of Non-Business Logic 📦**: By focusing on business
  logic, Sparkle minimizes the complexity associated with maintaining
  Spark applications.
- **Heavily Tested Framework 🔍**: All non-business functionalities
  are thoroughly tested, reducing the risk of bugs and ensuring a
  stable environment for data applications.

## How It Works 🛠️

The Sparkle framework operates on a principle similar to Function as a
Service (FaaS). Developers can instantiate a Sparkle application that
takes a list of input DataFrames and focuses solely on transforming
these DataFrames according to the business logic. The Sparkle
application then automatically writes the output of this
transformation to the desired destination.
